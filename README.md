# Dracula
This Discord bot has been used on the official Vampirism server (Vampirism.co) to add administrative features, various commands and automations.

It relies on [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), which has been discontinued and will probably stop working in April 2022.

In other words, don't try to use it. I've learned Python ***while*** creating this bot, so in addition to that, there are probably dozens of stupid, inefficient & unsecure lines of code in here.
